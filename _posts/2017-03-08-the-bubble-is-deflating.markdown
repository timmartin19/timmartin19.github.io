&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past few years have been incredibly fortuitous for Silicon Valley.
It seems like every few days a new "Unicorn" is coronated.  Everybody
is making money (with a few exceptions) and nobody wants
the party to end.  Unfortunately, the bars close at 2 and a hangover
is coming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time since the Great Recession, economic growth has been slow
with one glaring exception, the tech industry.  Investors are flocking to
the Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, "chasing the yield" as they would say.  Nobody
wants to miss out on the money and successful startups are incredibly
difficult to identify. The solution according to some VCs? Spray-and-Pray. 
From an individual VCs
perspective, spray-and-pray isn't necessarily a bad idea when the market is
hot.  Sure, there may make a lot of duds but one Ãœber more than
makes up for them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happens when too many VCs takes a spray-and-pray approach?  Bad
companies get investments too.  At their Series A round they 
get a valuation of 10M dollars just because some investors happened to
pick them.  In their Series B they're worth 100M because they happened
to hit a lucky streak in investment roulette.  Suddenly, everyone is talking
about this company that is exploding in valuation.  Sure they are nowhere
close to making a profit but "we're investing in future value".  This
drives more investment interest because nobody wants to miss out on
the rocketship.  Next thing you know that company is "worth" 28 Billion dollars 
yet is somehow [bleeding half a unicorn] a year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hangover is coming.  The Federal Reserve is [raising interest
rates] which means that capital in Silicon Valley is
going to be harder to find.  Companies relying on
future funding rounds are suddenly SOL.  It will start slow but eventually
people will see the emperor's new clothes for what they really are.
Investors will stop investing because they don't want to be left holding
the bag.  This leads to more start-ups going under because they can't raise 
the capital and the vicious cycle repeats.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we're lucky, the bubble will deflate rather than burst.  The good 
companies won't be swept out with the waste.  VCs will start doing their
jobs; identifying companies with actual potential.  The [schemers and scammers]
will be flushed out of the system.  Given that I work in the software startup world,
I hope that is how it turns out.  Maybe I just don't want to face up to the
reality.
